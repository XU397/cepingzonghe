Shared layer for reusable UI, services, types, and styles.

Structure
- `ui/`        Reusable UI primitives and composites
- `services/`  API, storage, timers, submission, logging
- `types/`     Type definitions (TS allowed)
- `styles/`    Global tokens and shared CSS

Conventions
- Use `@shared/*` aliases for imports.
- Keep modules framework-agnostic where practical.
