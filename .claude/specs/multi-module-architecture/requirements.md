# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the current single-module steamed bun assessment application into a multi-module architecture that can support multiple educational assessment types while maintaining a unified login system and shared codebase infrastructure.

The current application is a React-based educational assessment for steamed bun science inquiry with 29 pages (P0-P28), including task pages, simulation environment, and questionnaire components. The refactoring aims to create a scalable architecture where new assessment modules can be easily added while reusing common components and maintaining consistent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure multiple assessment modules in the system, so that different types of educational assessments can be deployed under the same application instance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration data defining available assessment modules
2. WHEN a new assessment module is added THEN the system SHALL support it without requiring changes to the core login or routing infrastructure
3. WHEN accessing the application THEN users SHALL see a unified interface regardless of which assessment module they will be routed to

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student user, I want to use the same login interface for all assessment types, so that I have a consistent authentication experience regardless of the specific assessment I need to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any assessment module THEN they SHALL be presented with the same login page interface
2. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL determine the appropriate assessment module based on account information returned from the server
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error messaging regardless of intended assessment module

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student user, I want to be automatically routed to the correct assessment module after login, so that I don't need to manually select which assessment to take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user login is successful THEN the system SHALL parse the server response for module routing information
2. WHEN the server response contains a valid module identifier THEN the system SHALL navigate to the appropriate assessment module
3. WHEN the server response contains an invalid or missing module identifier THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the login page
4. WHEN routing to an assessment module THEN the system SHALL preserve all authentication context and user session data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want assessment modules to be organized in separate directory structures, so that code for different assessments is maintainable and doesn't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing code THEN each assessment module SHALL have its own dedicated directory structure
2. WHEN a module is developed THEN it SHALL be able to import and use shared components, services, and utilities
3. WHEN one module is modified THEN it SHALL NOT require changes to other modules unless explicitly modifying shared components
4. WHEN building the application THEN all modules SHALL be bundled efficiently without unnecessary code duplication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared components and services to be centrally managed, so that common functionality can be reused across all assessment modules without duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing common UI components THEN they SHALL be located in a shared components directory accessible to all modules
2. WHEN implementing API services THEN they SHALL be centrally located and configurable for different module needs
3. WHEN implementing authentication logic THEN it SHALL be shared across all modules through common context providers
4. WHEN implementing utility functions THEN they SHALL be organized in shared utilities accessible to all modules

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the module routing system to be extensible, so that new assessment types can be added without modifying the core routing logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new assessment module THEN the routing system SHALL automatically recognize it based on configuration
2. WHEN the system determines module routing THEN it SHALL use a consistent interface that all modules implement
3. WHEN a module is loaded THEN it SHALL have access to all necessary shared services and context providers
4. WHEN module switching occurs THEN all shared state SHALL be properly managed and isolated per module

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the refactored system to maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs and data structures, so that current deployments continue to work without backend changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL use the same endpoints and data formats as the current implementation
2. WHEN submitting assessment data THEN it SHALL follow the existing FormData structure and field naming conventions
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN it SHALL continue to use the same RSA encryption and parameter formats
4. WHEN logging operations THEN it SHALL maintain the same data structure and submission patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build and development process to remain consistent, so that existing development workflows continue to work with the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development commands THEN they SHALL continue to work with the same npm scripts (dev, build, lint, preview)
2. WHEN building for production THEN the output SHALL maintain the same structure and deployment requirements
3. WHEN debugging the application THEN existing development tools and configurations SHALL continue to function
4. WHEN managing dependencies THEN the same package.json structure and tooling SHALL be maintained
